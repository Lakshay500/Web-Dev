  <h1>Lakshay Anand</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Lakshay. I enjoy exploring technology, creating projects, and learning new skills that help me grow.</p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>I’m currently learning C++ and love exploring how software is built from the ground up. 
     I’m also a big fan of movies, whether it’s classic dramas or the latest thrillers. 
     Beyond tech and films, I enjoy travelling especially road trips to places, I've never been to before
     and discovering new cultures, food, and experiences.
